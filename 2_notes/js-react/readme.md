# What is react-redux
Consider the entire web stack, separated into three components:
[ higher frontend, lower frontend, backend-server ]

1. higher frontend -> REACT. where the js rendering code sits.
2. lower frontend -> REDUX. the js where the variables and frontend logic sits and eval happens.
3. backend-server -> FLASK. API stuff ezpz
