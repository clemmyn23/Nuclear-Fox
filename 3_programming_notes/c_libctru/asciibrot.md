I wanna try out coding on ~~bare metal~~ the 3DS and also appreciate the work the reverse engineering team did.


### Project Status
1. ~~Set up libctru development toolchain and homebrew.~~
2. ~~Pull the mandelbrot algo from my first-year projects somewhere...~~
3. ~~Implement ascii mandelbrot~~
4. ~~Implement 3DS control handling etc.~~
5. Reimplement using GPU shaders assembly for calculation
6. Reimplement using one of the homebrew 3DS GPU libs 

### Usage

2. Download the .3dsx and .smdh files
3. Put into /3ds/_mandelbrot_folder_name/ (mkdir if necessary)
